# Bank Logger

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/DarkAlek/bank_logger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/DarkAlek/bank_logger) <--- Tests failing because of blank credentials :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Bank Logger is the simple project which reads accounts data from my bank.

  - Just pass your login and password to scraper constructor.
  - Program should out of the box log in to your bank account and read some basic info about your open accounts.
  

### TODOs

 - Rewrite Javascript to Java
 - Write MORE Tests
 - Add support to different login methods
 - Research scraper effectiveness with different accounts
 - Better reaction for extraordinary login scenarios
